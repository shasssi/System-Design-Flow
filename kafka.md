Genearlly DB has LOW Throughput (operation per second).
Kafka solves this issue - It has HIGH Throughput.
##### ðŸ“Œ Kafka Concepts
1. Producer (Data Producer)
2. Consumer (Consumes the data -> Proocess -> Bulk DB Insert)
3. Consumer Group (Multiple consumers in a single Group, Can have multiple groups as well)
4. Topic (Logical partitioning of the messages/data)
5. Partition (Split the data into multiple partitions) eg. partitioned based on area wise (location)
6. Offset
7. Broker (kafka server)
8. CLuster (multiple kafka servers)
9. Zookeper
10. Queue (only one producer -> only one consumer) RabitMQ, SQS
11. pub/sub (one producer -> can have multiple consumers)
